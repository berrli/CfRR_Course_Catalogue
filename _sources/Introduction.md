# Welcome to Intermediate Python

This Jupyter book contains the content for the Intermediate Python course, which uses the real-world problem of air pollution concentration data to highlight the power of key Python packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. The format of this book is as follows and will guide you through a range of different Python packages that allow you to analyse, visualise and model data within the Python ecosystem.

This course is intended to be taken after the Introduction to Python course [Introduction to Python](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-to-python/)

## Pre-requisite knowledge

To engage appropriately with the course's content, a beginner's knowledge of Python, either through self-study or a course such as Coding for Reproducible Research Introduction to Python, is needed. Topics include general data structures such as variables and lists, control flow such as for and if statements, and functions. If you are uncomfortable with or need a refresher on any of those courses then the CfRR Introduction to Python course is available here:
