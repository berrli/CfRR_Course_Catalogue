## Welcome

Welcome to this workshop on Computational Thinking. Over two sessions we are going to step back from programming and consider how we go about designing a programming solution. What we will cover is agnostic of any specific programming language and is a transferable set of skills that will help you develop as a programmer.

## Introduction to Coding For Reproducible Research

This workshop is offered as part of the [Coding For Reproducible Research Initiative](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/workshop-homepage/). 
Our ambition is to offer a recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students, with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to expand their skill-sets and position them to confidently perform the informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. A key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard, that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new training needs are identified.

Championed by and in partnership with

- Research Software Engineering group
- Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)
- Researcher Development (Doctoral College and ECRs)
- Reproducibility Network Institutional Leadership team
- Quantitative Health Network (QHN) 
- EPSRC Hub for Quantitative Modelling in Healthcare
- Translational Research Exchange @ Exeter (TREE)

This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by a series of working groups formed by researchers from across the University supported by Exeter's Research Software Engineering Group. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution. We appreciate your patience as we develop and test these materials and are grateful for your feedback which is a core component of this process. We also need to maintain accurate records of how many participants we have reached, so ask you to mark you attendance on the google spreadsheet.

## Workshop format

Today's workshop is led by XX and supported by XX. We are all here because we are passionate about sharing our knowledge and supporting the development of our colleagues. For most of us, this is not a requirement of our current position and we are doing this at the margins of our time.

The workshop will consist of discussion of relevant topics and some activities to practise the skills and techniques that we introduce. These activities are designed to be playful and very different to the sort of problems your workshop focuses on. However, through these we hope that you can see how these can benefit your own coding projects. We will pause for a break every 60-90 minutes.  This is a hybrid workshop, please be aware of this, online participants we find that engagement is higher if you are willing to turn your cameras on. There will be a dedicated helper for online participants please, either raise your hand or type any questions into the chat. In person participants you are also able to use the Teams link to join the chat. 

Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, there are helpers in the room so raise your hand if you need assistance. There is also a dedicated helper for the virtual participants so please raise your virtual hand to attract their attention. In person participants you are welcome to post questions in the Teams chat.  

We would like to highlight that we have a [code of conduct](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/computational-thinking/code.html) and by attending this workshop you are agreeing to abide by it. 

Let's get started.
