    "# GitHub Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will go through some examples of typical workflows for collaborating with GitHub.\n",
    "The vast majority of the examples will directly translate to other hosting platforms, such as <https://bitbucket.org/> or <https://git.exeter.ac.uk/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson will take the form of short demonstrations, followed by time to practice the workflow with you course mates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aside: Good Commit Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "When working collaboratively it is a good idea to adopt common conventions.\n",
    "A **strong** recommendation is to use a consistent format for commit messages.\n",
    "Having this consistency makes the workflows presented here, as well as the `log` and `blame` most effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the commit message should be a short summary, written in the imperative, of *what this commit will do if applied*.\n",
    "This title is what will show up in the one-line version of our history, and should be capitalised without punctuation.\n",
    "It can be equated to the subject of an e-mail.\n",
    "Some examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Update text on commit messages in workflow lesson\n",
    "- Fix missing dependency\n",
    "- Add links to each lesson in the schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "If further information would help describe the reasons for the commit, it can optionally be added to the body of the commit.\n",
    "This text should be separated from the title by a single blank line and ideally wrapped to 72 characters.\n",
    "GitHub allows for references to *issues* and *pull requests*, as we shall see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "An full example of a commit message:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` none\n",
    "Update text on commit messages in workflow lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "This serves as an example of good commit messages and will serve as a\n",
    "prompt to use good commit messages for the exercises in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a summary of best practice\n",
    "- an example commit message\n",
    "- a link to a post\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also helpful to group our commits into logical self-contained updates.\n",
    "This further increases the usefulness of the commit messages when reviewing the history.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [A Note About Git Commit Messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The first workflow we are going to look at it creating a **pull request**, or **PR**.\n",
    "In pure git this would be equivalent to asking someone to `git pull` the changes from your copy of their repository.\n",
    "Since this is such a common action for collaboration, GitHub allows you to go through this process in the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a *pull request* between any two branches.\n",
    "In this example, we will look at creating a pull request from a **forked** copy of a repository into the original repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to contribute to someone else's repository, we don't usually have write access, and hence we cannot push to it.\n",
    "Instead, we shall create a **fork** of the repository through the button on GitHub, at the top of a repository we want to work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try this now with <https://github.com/stephenpcook/intermediate-version-control>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will result a copy of the repository and its history with repository permissions associated with our user account.\n",
    "As such, we will be free to create branches on GitHub to upload our changes, before requesting the original author to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work on the files, `clone` the repository to your local machine.\n",
    "Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, from the green **Code** button copy the `https` URL, then clone from your terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sh\n",
    "git clone <https-url>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, follow the working patterns from the previous session to upload a new branch with some changes, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new branch: `git branch my-changes`\n",
    "- Switch to this branch: `git switch my-changes`\n",
    "- Make changes to a file (such as fixing a typo in lessen 7) then commit: `git add <file>`, `git commit -m \"Fix typo in lesson 7\"`\n",
    "- Finally, push your branch to *your* remote repository: `git push -u origin my-changes`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have verified that we can see the changes on a new branch in our fork, we are ready to create a pull request.\n",
    "For the repository in the above example, this can be found at <https://github.com/stephenpcook/intermediate-version-control/pulls>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notification will then be sent to the author of the repository.\n",
    "The pull request page allows for comments, discussion, and lets the maintainer ultimately accept or reject the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be demonstrated in the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have merged the pull request, we can delete the feature branch and, if the remote branch has been deleted from GitHub, our local reference to that:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sh\n",
    "git branch -d feature\n",
    "git fetch --prune\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "In pairs or small groups, practice making forks and Pull Requests on each-others' repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try creating a pull request, then have the original owner make conflicting changes before merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repositories with Collaborators and Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with colleagues, you are more likely to have some degree of access to the original repository.\n",
    "In this case (depending on the repository settings) we should be able to directly upload changes to this remote, and wont need to create a fork.\n",
    "We can still use pull requests from our branches to request to have our changes reviewed before arriving on `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Permissions can be set up to impose limits on different users, such as restricting who can push to `main` without an approved pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Issues and Linked Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature available on GitHub is **Issues**.\n",
    "Issues can serve as a place to discuss bugs, improvements and general changes prior to creating pull requests.\n",
    "Issues can be linked to pull requests through their IDs, represented on GitHub by a number with a hash symbol (e.g., #1).\n",
    "Similarly, pull requests can be linked to issues through *their* IDs - in a repository, issues and pull requests use the same sequential IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull requests can be set up to automatically close issues when merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many open-source projects hosted on GitHub require that contributors create issues prior to creating a pull request.\n",
    "This requirement, along with any other considerations, are typically outlined in a document called `COLLABORATING.md` or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice creating issues, linking them with pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tagging Versions and Releases\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are going to produce outputs from code in our repository or distribute our code, it is a good idea to **tag** the commit with a **version number**.\n",
    "This way, we can be more confident that we can exactly reproduce the state of the code, so ideally we can use identical inputs to create identical outputs, i.e., we strive towards **Reproducibility**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice for creating version numbers is to use **Semantic Versioning** (see <https://semver.org/>).\n",
    "A version might look like `v3.11.9`, which would be major version 3, minor version 11, patch 9.\n",
    "This would be added to the local and remote repositories with\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git tag v3.11.9\n",
    "git push origin v3.11.9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From GitHub, we can then create a **release** from this tagged version.\n",
    "This can either be an automatically assembled zip (compressed archive) file, or by preparing our own archive with attached documentation and/or executables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were linking code in a GitHub repository to a academic publication, we would typically archive a version on a website such as <https://zenodo.org/>.\n",
    "This would form a persistent archive (a maintainer can always delete a repository) and give the version a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributing to Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen the main mechanisms for collaborating on projects, and should feel comfortable working with colleagues.\n",
    "There are some additional considerations before attempting to make contributions to projects on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to check, is whether the project is being actively maintained.\n",
    "As mentioned above, it is always advisable to read the **Collaborating** guidelines for a project, and a repository may outline a **Code of Conduct**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can expect to find some sort of **LICENSE**.\n",
    "The type of license may impose restrictions on how the code can be used (e.g., non-commercial uses only), and whether there are further restrictions on any code that uses the licensed code (e.g., code that uses derivative of the code might need to have an identical license).\n",
    "If a repository has no license, you are actually *more* restricted on what you can legally do with the files (an important consideration if you plan on sharing your own work on GitHub).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to be aware of the main families of licenses you are likely to meet.\n",
    "A good place to start is <https://choosealicense.com/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen some typical workflows that enable collaboration through GitHub.\n",
    "These workflows are also typical for platforms beside GitHub.\n",
    "There are additional tools for planning and organising projects outside the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this course we'll see how we can rewrite our history, and when doing so should be avoided.\n",
    "We'll also see the tools we have available to get unstuck when applying these more complicated changes.\n"
