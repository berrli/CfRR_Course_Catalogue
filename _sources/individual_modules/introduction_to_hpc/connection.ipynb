    "# How do I connect to a HPC Cluster?\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect to the ISCA HPC system with your university credentials\n",
    "- Create an ssh `config` file for easier access via the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Via the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking \n",
    "The most common way to connect to a remove HPC server is via a command line shell program `ssh`. This application uses the Secure SHell protocol (or SSH) to open an encrypted network connection between two machines, allowing you to send & receive text and data without having to worry about prying eyes. It should be available in all terminal apps (Windows, Linux, & Mac), but to doublecheck type `ssh` into your terminal of choice and press enter. If it is installed properly, you should get output like that below.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "you@laptop:~$ ssh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "usage: ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface]\n",
    "           [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port]\n",
    "           [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11]\n",
    "           [-i identity_file] [-J [user@]host[:port]] [-L address]\n",
    "           [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port]\n",
    "           [-Q query_option] [-R address] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port]\n",
    "           [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] destination [command [argument ...]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do *not* get this output, please let the instructor know. But don't worry, there are other means of connecting to the system and well will cover those in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logging In\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you were given access to the system by an administrator, you should be able to login with your standard university credentials. The syntax for logging into a machine with `ssh` is \n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "you@laptop:~$ ssh username@hostname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `username` is your standard login and the `hostname` is address of the server you wish to log into. For this workshop the `hostname` will be `login02.isca.ex.ac.uk`. Don't forget the **@** symbol, like you would see in an email address. You will then be prompted for your university password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Time Warning\n",
    "An important security warning will occur whenever you attempt to log into another machine for the first time. \n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "The authenticity of host 'login02.isca.ex.ac.uk (144.173.114.23)' can't be established.\n",
    "ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:rPqlD8myIfJUQBINKPYCp47oIQm3sGVMUPSAWT26E/M.\n",
    "ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ah29tkixxl7NW/zdJM6TSbASY3UyLsKZEKUMMZSD3X0.\n",
    "This key is not known by any other names\n",
    "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that the IP address (i.e. `144.173.114.23`) and the appropriate key fingerprint that you get match the information found above. Any subsequent time you log into that same server, you should **not** see this message, as this server's fingerprint is saved in a list of `known_hosts`. If you do get this message while connecting to a server you have logged into previously, please contact a system administrator **immediately**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Config File\n",
    "\n",
    "Remembering the long hostnames can be a pain. We can create a config file that allows us to use shorter and more memorable ones for machines we use regularly using an ssh `config` file. For those using a Unix terminal, the two commands below will create a file with access restricted to just the current user.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "touch ~/.ssh/config\n",
    "chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up that file in your preferred text editor and copy the following example into it. **Remember** to swap your specific `username` for the placeholder.\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "# Configuration file for simplifying SSH logins\n",
    "Host login.isca\n",
    "    User your_username\n",
    "    Hostname login02.isca.ex.ac.uk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can log in with a far shorter and easier to remember command. But you still will be prompted for your password.\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "you@laptop:~$ ssh login.isca\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphical Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative means of connecting to a remote host server is via an application like the [Putty](https://putty.org/) SSH Client. It provides nice app-based way to save host connection configs so one need not input them again each time. Like the command line option, if you haven't logged in before, it will raise a *warning* message.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](fig/windows_putty.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be prompted in a new terminal session for your username and password.\n",
