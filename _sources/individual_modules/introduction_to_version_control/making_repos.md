# Making Repositories

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this episode you will be able to describe what a repository is
and how to create them, either by cloning an existing remote repository or
creating a new one locally from scratch. You'll also be able to create a
remote repository on GitHub.


## What is a repository?

In version control systems, such as Git, a **repository** is a space where
your files live together with information about the version history of the files.
In Git, this repository can live either _locally_ (i.e. on your own computer) or
_remotely_ (somewhere other than your own computer). Remote repositories may
be hosted on another machine, such as an institutional server, or
on a cloud-based service, such as GitHub.

It is perfectly possible to create a Git repository on your own computer and have
it exist in isolation. This allows you to keep a version history of files
that you develop within the repository, but doesn't provide a way to easily
share this developmental history with others, or collaborate with them on code.
The most common way that a person uses Git is instead to have a local repository
that is linked to a remote repository. A typical example is
where there is a remote repository on GitHub and you have a local version of the
repository on your own computer. You keep the remote repository up-to-date by
'pushing' updates made on your local repository to the remote repository (we will
look more at this later in the course). Someone else can then obtain a copy of your
work by getting it from the remote repository. 

We'll see later in this course that a whole team of developers can contribute
to a shared codebase by working with a common remote repository. In this set up,
the remote repository acts as a
central location for receiving updates from all team members, and these updates
are propagated throughout the team by the individual members keeping
their own local versions of the repository up-to-date with the remote one.


## Creating repositories

So how do you create repositories? We'll look at two different
ways to do this:

1. Creating a remote repository on GitHub.

2. 'Cloning' a remote repository to create a local version on your own computer.

Case 2 is probably the most immediately helpful for Git novices, allowing them
to get working with a repository that has already been set up by somebody else.
Case 1 is, of course, helpful if you find yourself in the situation of needing
to create a remote repository on GitHub... And it gives us something
to demonstrate case 2 with!

We'll also briefly cover how you can create a new repository on a computer
without using a platform like GitHub. You're less likely to come across this in
practice, but we cover it for completeness. 


### Creating a remote repository on GitHub

Below we outline simplified steps for creating a new repository on your personal
GitHub account, which will be adequate for this course. Full instructions for
creating repositories on GitHub can be found at
<https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository>.
In what follows, accept the default options on GitHub unless we specify
otherwise.

- **Step 1:** Log into your GitHub account.

- **Step 2:** Click on the '+' drop-down menu in the top-right corner and
  select _New repository_.

- **Step 3:** Enter the name for your repository.
  - This should be short and meaningful. Only use characters that you would use
    for naming folders on your own computer.

- **Step 4:** Choose whether to make your repository publicly visible or
  private. We suggest making any repositories you create for this course
  _private_, so that you can practice out of the gaze of the internet.
  - _Public_ repositories can be viewed by _anyone_ on the internet, even those
    who don't have a GitHub account. _Private_ repositories are only visible by
    you and people that you specifically invite.

- **Step 5:** In the section _Initialize this repository with:_, select the
  _Add a README file_ option. A readme file provides useful information to new
  users of the repository, explaining what the repository is for and generally
  helping them get started with using the code in it. This is not necessary, but
  it's good practice to include one whenever you create a new repository.

- **Step 6:** Click on _Create repository_ to finish and create the repository.

Immediately after creating the repository you'll be taken to the repository's
main page on GitHub. For now, the main thing to look at is the content under the
_Code_ tab in the top-left corner, which gives you a view of the contents
of the repository. (There won't be much in there to begin with, of course.)

In the future, you can return to the repository by going to your main
GitHub account page and finding it under the _Repositories_ tab. Notice that
the URL for the repository has the format `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`
where `user-name` is your GitHub username and `repo-name` is the name you gave
the repository.


#### Further options for GitHub repositories
Let's take a moment mention a few extra things about creating repositories on GitHub. None of these points are essential for moving forward, but you'll likely come into contact with them as you use GitHub more:
* When creating the repository, there was the option to initialise the repository with some extra files:
  - A `.gitignore` file. This is a particular file that can be used to tell Git about files that it should _not_ keep a version history for. We will see this later in the course.
  - A licence file. If you intend to make your work publicly available, then it's important to include a licence file which both allows others to use your work and specify the terms for their use. You can read more about this important topic <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">on GitHub</a> and on the <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/choosing-open-source-licence" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Software Sustainability Institute</a>'s website.
* If you belong to an _Organisation_ on GitHub and have the correct permissions, then you will be able to create repositories under the organisation instead of your own user account. See GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">overview on organisations</a> for more information. 


### Cloning a remote repository

We mentioned above that the most common way of using Git is to have a local
repository that is linked to a remote repository. In Git parlance, the local
repository is created by **cloning** the remote repository.

Any remote repository will have a URL which specifies its location — you can
recognise them in that they end with `.git`. You need this URL to clone the
remote repository.

#### Example: GitHub repositories
The URL for a remote repository on GitHub can be found by going to the repository's main webpage. Under the _Code_ tab, there is a green drop-down button, also labelled _Code_. Click this and copy the HTTPS address listed under the _Clone_ section — this is the URL for the remote repository. (Strictly speaking, this is the URL that uses the HTTPS protocol; other protocols, such as SSH, are available to use instead if you prefer. We'll use HTTPS for this course because it doesn't require extra set-up.)

To create a local 'clone' of the remote repository, navigate in the command-line
to a folder where you'd like to put your repository. Then run

``` bash
git clone <remote-repo-url>
```

This will create a new folder with the same name as the remote repository and
download all the repository's contents into it.


#### GitHub authentication
If the remote repository is private, you may be prompted to enter yourGitHub username and a password. Use your Personal Access Token for the password, not your GitHub account password.

If you instead want to put the contents of the repository into a specific
folder, then use the form

``` bash
git clone <remote-repo-url> path/to/folder
```
#### Example
Joe Bloggs created a remote repository on GitHub called `test-repo` and the remote repository's URL is `https://github.com/jbloggs9999/test-repo.git`. On his Mac, he navigates to the folder `~/Documents/Repositories` and runs

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/jbloggs9999/test-repo.git
```

This creates a new folder called `test-repo` within his `Repositories` folder, which contains the local, cloned repository. If he instead had run
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/jbloggs9999/test-repo.git my-test-repo-clone/
```
then this would have put the contents of the repository into the folder `~/Documents/Repositories/my-test-repo-clone`.


### Creating a new repository on your computer

We can also create a new repository from scratch on our computer. Since there
isn't any existing remote repository to clone from, we use a different command:

``` bash
git init path/to/new/repo
```

For example, running `git init foobar` will create a folder `foobar` in
our current working directory, which contains the new Git repository.

Using `git init` creates a repository that is contained on the host computer
only. This can be used if you just want to keep track of your work, with no
interest in sharing it with others or syncing it with a remote version. Other
than that, `git init` can also be used for manually setting up a repository 
that serves as a remote repository. This might be done on a
departmental server so that the remote repository is contained on the server, for example.
We won't say more on how to do this in this course, but if you are interested
then see the section on 'bare' repositories on
[Atlassian's tutorial page for `git init`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-init).


#### Renaming the default branch
In the previous episode, we discussed changing the name of the default branch from `master` to something else, e.g. `main`. For Git versions 2.28 and later, the configuration can be set so that new repositories have this new name by default, see the Setting up Git and GitHub episode. If the version of Git you are using is earlier than 2.28, then this needs to be done for each repository individually. After creating the repository with `git init`, run the following command:

```
$ git checkout -b main
```


## What does a local repository look like?

We'll conclude this episode with taking a peek into an example repository that has been
created locally, whether this be via cloning or using `git init`.

Let's consider an example, looking at the more organised folder of work
introduced in the episode Git vs GitHub.
Below is a screenshot of the repository on a Windows machine; note that we've
enabled the display of 'hidden' files and folders, i.e. those whose names
begin with a period.

![A simple Git repository on Windows](images/basic-repo.png)

And here is the same repository displayed on a Linux operating system, using the
command line; note we are displaying hidden files using the `-a` option
in the `ls` command:

``` bash
$ ls -a awesome-research-done-right/
.  ..  .git  data  plot_results.py  process_geo_data.py  run-everything.py  simulate.py  simulation-engine
```

It is common for people to refer to the top level folder of the repository as the 
**root folder**; in the above example,
`awesome-research-done-right` is the root folder. (Note: this is distinct from the
'root' folder `/` on Unix systems that you might have heard of.) By
default, Git will keep track of the version history of _all_ files located within the 
root folder or subfolders thereof. Where exactly does Git keep all the
versioning information? Answer: it's kept in the `.git` folder, which you may
have spotted in the example outputs above. This is a folder that Git creates
automatically when the repository is created.


### Warning!
As a general rule, don't go modifying the files in the `.git` folder within a repository. Accidentally modifying a file / subfolder will likely mess up the version history of the repository. There are files in the `.git` folder that are suitable for direct modification, allowing users to customise their interaction with Git, but this comes under more advanced use that is beyond the scope of this course.
Our advice: don't poke around the `.git` folder, unless you are a confident Git user and need to customise Git (even then, follow a reputable tutorial or guide the first time).
