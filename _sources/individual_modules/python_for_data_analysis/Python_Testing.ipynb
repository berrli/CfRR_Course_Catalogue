    "\n",
    "### System level testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have completed our software we should ensure that it works as intended.  This is referred to as - validation testing.  Typically this will involve taking a sample of input data and ensuring that the output of our software is as expected for the given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This *validation* testing will tell us in the overall system runs, and produces valid results.  Such tests should be repeated when changes are made to the software, to ensure the changes have not introduced errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes that can impact your software are diverse and include \n",
    "\n",
    " * new Python language releases\n",
    " \n",
    " * upgrades to imported libraries\n",
    " \n",
    " * operating system updates.\n",

    "### Defect testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In a research environment it is often the case that there is no explicit specification for the software we create.\n",
    "\n",
    "By specification we mean something like\n",
    "\n",
    "* Written statement of user requirements - typically \"user stories\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functional requirements - e.g what file formats are to be supported\n",

    "### Test Driven Development (TDD)\n",
    "\n",
    "TDD is an approach to software design, it is not software testing. TDD uses unit-tests to create a software design, especially when the design is created incrementally, as with Agile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not you adopt TDD, refactoring - changing the implementation of your code without changing its behaviour, is something that you are certain to do. If only to remove print statements, or change the names of variables.\n",
    "\n",
