# Python for Data Analysis

## Prerequisites

An understanding and experience of Python programming from, for example, attending Intro to Python. 

Participants should have experience running Python commands and scripts on their machines.

## Setup

A working Python environment (3.10 or later)

An IDE (Anaconda, PyCharm, VS Code)

## Course overview

More advanced Python features, including usage of virtual environments, tools to check and test Python code, object orientation, and some commonly seen coding patterns. We will move on to working with Python libraries for data analysis, such as Pandas and Numpy, using libraries for visualising data, such as matplotlib, and create data pipelines.
