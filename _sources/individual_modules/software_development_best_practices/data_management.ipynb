    "## During the Research Project: Acquisition, Processing, and Analysis Phase\n",
    "### Responsibilities and Data Handling\n",
    "**Responsibility**: Each individual involved in handling the data is accountable for its integrity and security. This emphasizes the collective responsibility of the research team towards the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Organization and Versioning\n",
    "**File Structure and Naming**: Employing a logical file structure with meaningful file names is essential. This practice facilitates the easy location and tracking of files throughout the project lifecycle.\n",
    "**Read-only Settings**: Setting files to read-only mode is a preventive measure against the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "**Manual Versioning**: If opting for manual versioning of data files, each version should be distinctly named using dates or version numbers. Additionally, maintaining a supplementary file that logs details of changes can enhance traceability.\n",
    "**Version Control Software**: For more systematic version control, software tools like Git can be used. These tools help manage changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, and other collections of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Strategies\n",
    "**Consistent Data Representation**: Strategies for data processing, including how to handle missing data consistently, should be decided at the project's onset. It is crucial that all collaborators agree on these strategies to ensure uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage and Security\n",
    "**University Storage Options**: Researchers are provided with secure data storage solutions such as OneDrive, SharePoint, Research Data Storage (RDS), and Secure Data Research Hub (SDRH) by the university.\n",
    "**Portable Storage Devices**: While convenient, portable storage devices like USB sticks are vulnerable and less secure. If used, these devices should be encrypted to protect data.\n",
    "**Backup Strategy**: Implementing a robust backup strategy is vital for data security throughout the project. The recommended approach is the 3-2-1 principle, which involves keeping three copies of the data on two different media, with one copy stored in a separate physical location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation and Metadata\n",
    "**Importance of Documentation**: Data without its contextual information is often meaningless. Thus, maintaining thorough documentation throughout the project is essential.\n",
    "**Metadata**: Metadata, or data about data, is crucial as it provides understanding and context to the main data collected. Documentation and metadata combined should render the data comprehensible and functional independent of any publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are critical practices and strategies to be implemented during the acquisition, processing, and analysis phases of a research project. By adhering to these guidelines, researchers can ensure effective data management that safeguards the integrity, security, and usability of research data."
