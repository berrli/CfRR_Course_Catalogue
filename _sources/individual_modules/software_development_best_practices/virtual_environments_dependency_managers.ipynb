    "# Virtual Environment and Dependency Managers \n",
    "This session will guide you through the basics of virtual environments and dependency management in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Basics \n",
    "### Why Use External Libraries?\n",
    "Most Python projects require external libraries, known as third-party packages or dependencies, like matplotlib. These libraries provide specific functionalities, and sometimes, specific versions are needed for your project.\n",
    "### Dependency Management \n",
    "A dependency manager like pip allows you to specify and manage versions of dependencies required for your projects. It handles the installation and updates of these dependencies.\n",
    "### Virtual Environments \n",
    "Using a virtual environment (venv in Python) helps isolate and manage project-specific dependencies. This isolation simplifies development, testing, and collaboration across different projects and environments."

    "## Key Steps and Commands\n",
    "### Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "- Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "- Navigate to your project directory.\n",
    "- Create a virtual environment with: `python3 -m venv myenv` (replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "- On MacOS/Linux, activate with: `source myenv/bin/activate`\n",
    "- On Windows, activate with: source `myenv/Scripts/activate`\n",
    "- Your command prompt will show the environment name in brackets once activated.\n",
    "- Remember, if reactivating later, navigate to your project directory first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies\n",
    "- Install a library, e.g., `matplotlib`, by running: `python3 -m pip install matplotlib`\n",
    "- For a specific version, use: `python3 -m pip install matplotlib==3.7.0`\n",
    "- To view installed dependencies: `python3 -m pip list`\n",
    "- To remove a dependency: `python3 -m pip uninstall package-name`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Dependencies with requirements.txt\n",
    "- Generate a `requirements.txt` file: `python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt`\n",
    "- This file can be used by others to replicate your environment using: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "- Update and maintain this file regularly, especially after changes to your environment.\n",
    "### Deactivating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "- Simply run deactivate to exit your virtual environment.\n",
    "- The environment name will disappear from your command prompt.\n",
