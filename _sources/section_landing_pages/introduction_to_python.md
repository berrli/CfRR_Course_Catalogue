# Introduction to Python

## Overview 

Welcome to Intro to Python!

Python is one of the most popular general-purpose programming languages around. It is used in a huge range of applications, from building systems incorporating cutting-edge machine learning, such as in self-driving cars, to building web applications with hundreds of millions of users, as seen in Instagram.

As researchers, we use Python for all manner of tasks, from data analysis, to automation, to prototyping software, to creating engaging visuals for websites and publications. Like you, we started our journey into Python learning the basics, building a strong foundation for achieving these more complex tasks. This introductory course will teach you these basics, and get you up to speed on your own programming journeys.

## Course Objectives

This course will enable you to:

- Understand and declare the basic data types in Python
- Understand the basic principles of control flow and for loops
- Describe what a function is and define one that takes user-specified parameters
- Perform simple data analysis/visualisation of a table of data
- Recognise concepts in other programming languages

## Pre-requisite Knowledge

No pre-requisite knowledge needed. However, course attendees will need to follow our setup guide to install Python and JupyterLab, which we will use for the course.

## Feedback 

Please remember to complete a feedback survey. Our workshops are under continual review and your experiences, suggestions and criticism are invaluable for shaping the direction of this initiative. This is especially important if you complete the materials in your own time as it enables us to measure impact.
